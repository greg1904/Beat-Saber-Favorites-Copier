# Beat Saber Favorites Copier

This is just a small python script I use when I want to give my buddy or someone else my custom song - I sort them with would share and would not share with the favorites function.

"the songhash is the sha1 hash of the contents of the levels info.dat and all of the difficulties concatinated together, in the order that they appear in the info.dat"
