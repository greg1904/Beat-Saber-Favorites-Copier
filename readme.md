# Beat Saber Favorites Copier

This is just a small python script I use when I want to give my buddy or someone else my favorite custom songs - I sort them with the in-game heart button.
It copies the named custom songs in the PlayerData.dat to a selectable output directory.

"the songhash is the sha1 hash of the contents of the levels info.dat and all of the difficulties concatinated together, in the order that they appear in the info.dat"
